# PATECH PCB Template Project
This template project aims to make you design a PCB without getting confused and save time.

# License
- I upgrade this template PCB from **FEDEVEL** and create mine.

- It's an open-source project; feel free to use it in your company or for your projects.

# How to use it
Each directory and subdirectory has a readme.txt file with a detailed explanation about what files should be placed there.
To start using this structure, simply press "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP". Unpack the zip and place the main directories on your server(s).

# What to consider
You may want to place the "Design Files" & "Released Files" directories on your regularly backed-up server. "Project Files" are not required to be backed up (if something happens, you can usually re-download all the documents).
